	<p>
		I'm a Undergraduate Student at International Institue of Information Technology, Hyderabad. I'm pursuing Bachelor's Dergree in Computer Science and Engineering. I live in Bikaner, Rajasthan. I am from Orrisa, but I live in Bikaner due my father's Job. I have a older brother who is in his 3rd year in BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus.

	<p>
		I like to watch anime and movies too. Walking around nearby where I live or in IIIT campus at night is one of the best things I've experienced in life.
	</p>
	<p>
		I like reading about new astrophysics discorveris. One of a recent discovery being the proof that the neutron star mergers do produce short gamma bursts.

		I don't know what else to write so I'm putting a picture of me and my friends here ....
